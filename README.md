Bean Scopes
===================

There are various types of bean scopes. The important ones are:
    1. Singleton (default)
    2. Prototype

With Singleton scope the bean is instantiated once and the same instance is used for various implementations.
With Prototype scope, the number of times bean is called that much of times the instance of bean is created.
